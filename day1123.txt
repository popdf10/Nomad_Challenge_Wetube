아직 끝난 거 아니라구요! 후후후. 마지막 최종 보스 나갑니다!
아래 API 를 불러와서 '리얼타임' 암호화폐 가격을 추적하는 대시보드를 만드세요.
Using the awesome Coinpaprika API(https://api.coinpaprika.com/) build a "real-time" crypto price tracker dashboard!
There is one URL (https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/tickers) that gives you all the coins with their price in USD
Call the URL when the page loads
Show me a loading indicator when the request is happening
When the data comes, paint all the coins with their prices.
Every 5 seconds call the URL again and repaint the results
IF ANY OF THE REQUIREMENTS ARE NOT FULFILLED YOU WILL GET AN ❌


Notes
Because the API is now on https you can work on Codesandbox for this one.
